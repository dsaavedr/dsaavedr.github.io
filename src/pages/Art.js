                    A big part of development is user experience. Although its design can be very technical, it involves a great deal of creativity and, along with the design of the page, can turn the end product into a piece of art. Here are a few websites that showcase my point:
                        </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.feedmusic.com/" target="_blank">feedmusic.com</a></li>
                    <li><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/" target="_blank">etq-amsterdam.com</a></li>
                    <li><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.mikiyakobayashi.com/" target="_blank">mikiyakobayashi.com</a></li>
                    <li><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://movie-mark.com/" target="_blank">movie-mark.com</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The immense versatility of these tools not only allows you to create beautiful and functional websites, but stand-alone art, animations and effects. These are some of the things I've come up with:</p>
            </div>
